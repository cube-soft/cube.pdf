## Overview

CubePDF Page is a software for merging and splitting PDF files and image files (BMP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF).

CubePDF Page requires .NET Framework 3.5 or later (4.7 or later recommended).

## How to use

Add files to be merged or split to the file list by using the Add button or drag&drop.
Then press the Merge or Split button and a dialog box will appear to specify where to save the file.

When merging PDF files, they are merged from the top of the file list.
The order in which files are displayed in the file list can be changed by clicking the Up or Down button after the file is added.

When the Split button is pressed, CubePDF Page will split all pages of the added PDF file into separate files, one page at a time.
If you want to extract only a specific group of pages, split all pages once and then re-merge only the pages you need.
